# Password Managers

This dotfiles repository uses chezmoi's powerful feature to read secrets from password managers.

This achieves 2 main goals:

- Making sure that sensitive information (IP, keys, etc.) are not shared in the `dotfiles` repository

- Keeping secrets cleanly separated (personal, professional, etc.)

## CLI & Desktop Apps

The CLI version of each password manager connected to chezmoi is required.

For a server, you only need the CLI versions.

For a laptop, you'll want to install them alongside the desktop versions.
